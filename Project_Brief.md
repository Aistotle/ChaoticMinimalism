Project Brief

Chaotic Minimalism Blog — A Connected Universe of Thought

⸻

Purpose

Create a minimal, highly usable, elegant blog platform focused on ideas about AI philosophy, AI safety, consciousness, and the future of intelligence.

Prioritize:
	•	Simple, inviting surface aesthetics
	•	Subtle depth for future expansion
	•	Exceptional mobile and laptop usability
	•	Immediate launchability with lightweight, robust technology
	•	Integration of personal AI-generated artwork to enhance emotional resonance without disrupting minimalism

Core Mindset for This Project

You are not just building a blog.
You are assisting in creating a home for thought.

Maintain this mental model:
	•	Aesthetic simplicity over visual noise
	•	Deep functional coherence over feature sprawl
	•	Ultra-high usability over novelty
	•	Respect for reader immersion above all

Always ask:

“Does this decision make the experience deeper, cleaner, more inevitable?”

If not, strip it away.

Golden Rules
	•	Minimal viable beauty: Build the simplest possible structure that still feels thoughtfully designed.
	•	No overengineering: Avoid complex databases, massive frameworks, or heavy CMS hacks.
	•	Respect manual curation: Manual linking between posts is good. No automated “related posts” engines.
	•	Frictionless interaction: Clicking, scrolling, and reading must feel inevitable and seamless.
	•	Subtle interactivity only: Light hover effects, tooltip reveals, and micro-animations allowed. No gamified systems.

⸻

Hard Constraints
	•	Performance First:
Site must easily pass Google’s Core Web Vitals.
Minimal custom JavaScript. No heavy frontend frameworks.
	•	Accessibility:
Must meet WCAG AA standards (good contrast, alt-texts, full keyboard navigation).
	•	Hostability:
Must be easy to host on Vercel, Netlify, or Ghost(Pro).
	•	Coding Simplicity:
Prefer customizing existing minimalist templates/themes rather than building from scratch — unless extremely lightweight.

Recommended Stack Choices

Core Platform Options:
	•	Ghost CMS (preferred, modern, clean, content-focused)
	•	Hugo Static Site Generator (acceptable if needed for faster static builds)

Hosting Options:
	•	Vercel or Netlify (for Hugo/static builds)
	•	Ghost(Pro) (if choosing Ghost CMS with managed hosting)

Styling:
	•	TailwindCSS if static site and needed
	•	Or light manual custom CSS for Ghost themes

Minimal Tech Features:
	•	Light scroll-based animations (simple fade-ins only)
	•	Hover-to-reveal microinteractions
	•	Proper SEO meta-tags embedding

Visual and Layout Requirements

Typography:
	•	Headings: Serif font (example: Newsreader, Alegreya)
	•	Body text: Sans-serif font (example: Inter, Lato, Source Sans)
	•	Generous line-height for maximum readability

Colors:
	•	Background: Soft warm gray (not pure white)
	•	Text: Dark gray (not pure black)
	•	Accent: One muted color only (deep blue or burnt orange preferred)

Layout:
	•	Wide margins on desktop/laptop
	•	Single-column reading flow
	•	Mobile-first responsive design (but ensure excellent laptop experience)

Homepage Layout:
	•	Featured post on top, with thumbnail image (personal AI art)
	•	Latest posts listed underneath, each with a small thumbnail image

Post Pages Layout:
	•	Each post begins with a full-width header image (personal AI artwork)
	•	Title and subtitle below the image
	•	Then clean, flowing body text
	•	Light manual “Thread Continuation” links at the bottom (suggesting 2–3 posts)

Content-Image Guidelines:
	•	Every post must include:
	•	An AI-generated thumbnail for the homepage
	•	A full-width AI-generated header image on the post page
	•	Images must be optimized (compressed for performance)
	•	Alt-text must be provided for accessibility and SEO
	•	Images should thematically reflect the article content (no generic stock)

Visual Touch for Headers:
	•	Use slight separation (margin, thin divider, or gradient fade) between header image and article body

⸻

Minimal Interactive Features
	•	Hover over links and titles triggers a gentle visual effect (underline, mild tilt, or glow)
	•	Hover over thumbnails could softly zoom or fade
	•	Clicking a title or image leads cleanly to the article
	•	Soft fade-in of header image and title on scroll (if easily implemented)
	•	No parallax, scroll-jacking, or heavy visual distractions

⸻

Content Setup
	•	Upload existing article backlog
	•	Set original creation dates correctly
	•	(Optional) Add small note at the end of posts: “Originally written in [year]”

Archive Page:
	•	Chronological list of all posts
	•	Simple two-line layout (title and optional short description)

⸻

Launch Roadmap
	1.	Set up Ghost or Hugo skeleton
	2.	Choose or lightly customize minimalist theme
	3.	Upload article backlog with correct original dates
	4.	Integrate thumbnails and header images for each post
	5.	Implement basic hover and micro-interactions
	6.	Embed SEO metadata correctly
	7.	Run Lighthouse audit for performance optimization
	8.	Launch private beta to trusted readers for early feedback

⸻

Future Expansion Placeholder (Not for Version 1)

Plan architecture lightly so future additions will be easy, but do not build them yet:
	•	Thread Maps (graph visualization of article relationships)
	•	Phase Transition Effects on homepage
	•	Tiny Reader Profiles (ultralight community badges)

⸻

Final Mental Model for This Project

When in doubt:
	•	Simplify.
	•	Deepen the experience.
	•	Respect the reader’s mind.
