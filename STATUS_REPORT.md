# STATUS REPORT: Chaotic Minimalism Blog (as of 2025-04-17)

Welcome, fellow developer! Here’s a concise summary of what’s been set up, why, and how you can hit the ground running. This should save you hours of code spelunking, so you can focus on real improvements.

---

## 1. **Platform & Stack**
- **Static Site Generator:** Hugo
- **Theme:** hugo-blog-awesome (customized)
- **Language:** Markdown for content, HTML/CSS (with SCSS) for theming

## 2. **Key Features & Customizations**
- **Minimalist, readable design** with custom fonts, color palette, and generous spacing.
- **Homepage:**
  - Displays latest posts as cards, with 16:9 thumbnails (CSS-cropped, object-fit: cover)
  - Thumbnails, titles, dates, and descriptions all aligned for clarity
- **Article Pages:**
  - Full-width header image (falls back to thumbnail if not set)
  - Clean title, date, and content layout
  - Optional "Thread Continuation" links for manual curation of related posts
- **Archive Page:**
  - Chronological list of all posts (title, description, date)
  - Linked in main navigation

## 3. **Content Handling**
- **Posts live in:** `content/posts/`
- **Front matter supports:**
  - `title`, `date`, `description`, `thumbnail`, `header`, `tags`, and `thread_continuation` (array of `{url, title}`)
- **Images:** Place in `/static/images/` and reference with `/images/filename.jpg` in front matter

## 4. **Accessibility & SEO**
- All images have descriptive `alt` text (using post title)
- Semantic HTML structure: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` used throughout
- Meta tags for SEO, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards (auto-pulls header/thumbnail)
- Canonical URLs and RSS feeds enabled

## 5. **Configuration**
- **`config.toml`** sets `baseURL`, theme, date format, and mainSections (posts)
- Main navigation (menu) is defined in `config.toml` for best compatibility

## 6. **How to Develop/Run**
- Start local server: `hugo server --disableFastRender`
- Edit content in `content/posts/` or tweak theme in `themes/hugo-blog-awesome/`
- SCSS customizations live in `themes/hugo-blog-awesome/assets/sass/_custom.scss`

## 7. **What’s Polished & Ready**
- Homepage, article pages, and archive are all visually consistent and responsive
- Accessibility and SEO best practices are in place
- Navigation is robust (home icon, archive link)

## 8. **What’s Next?**
- Optional: Add Netlify CMS or similar for visual editing
- Add more sample posts or advanced features as needed
- Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or your preferred static host

**You’re set up for a fast, frustration-free handoff.**
If you have questions, check the config and the theme’s partials first—most custom logic lives there. Enjoy building!
